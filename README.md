# Data-Munging
This challenge is called Data Munging. It is a three-part challenge. We kindly request that you please complete each part individually (without reading ahead). Have fun with the challenge and don’t over think it, please complete all three parts as soon as you can.

PART ONE: Weather Data

In the attached weather.dat file, you’ll find daily weather data for Morristown, NJ for June 2002. Save this text file, then write a program to output the day number (found in column one) with the smallest temperature spread (the maximum temperature is the second column, the minimum temperature is the third column).

********** PLEASE DON’T READ AHEAD UNTIL YOU COMPLETE PART ONE **********

PART TWO: Soccer League Table

The attached file football.dat contains the results from the English Premier League for 2001/2. The columns labeled ‘F’ and ‘A’ contain the total number of goals scored for and against each team in that season (so Arsenal scored 79 goals against opponents, and had 36 goals scored against them). Write a program to print the name of the team with the smallest difference in ‘for’ and ‘against’ goals.

********** PLEASE DON’T READ AHEAD UNTIL YOU COMPLETE PART TWO **********

PART THREE: DRY Fusion

Take the two programs you previously completed and factor out as much common code as possible, leaving you with two smaller programs and some kind of shared functionality.
